Meet Lisa, your talking assistant.

Lisa is desinged to help you out with different tasks that you might enouter surfing the web. Think of Lisa as a personal customer support surfing the web. 

- You want to find out about your airlines baggage policy? Lisa can help you with that!
- You need to checkout trains from Amsterdam to Paris? Lisa can go fetch the information.

Lisa is still being built, and is not a comercial project. Just having fun with LLMs and browser use.
